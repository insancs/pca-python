# Principal Component Analysis using Python
Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.


The stages in this exercise are as follows:
1. Split the data set.
2. Train the model without PCA.
3. Train the model with PCA.
4. Evaluate the results of the two models.
